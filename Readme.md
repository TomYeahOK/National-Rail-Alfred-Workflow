# National Rail Alfred Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow was designed to allow me to quickly check when the next available train(s) are.

You can enter the full name of stations, e.g. 


## Scope
This isn’t particularly clever code. It just launches a web browser showing the appropriate details (this seemed better than pulling via API because the page should notify you if there are any major disruptions, etc.
